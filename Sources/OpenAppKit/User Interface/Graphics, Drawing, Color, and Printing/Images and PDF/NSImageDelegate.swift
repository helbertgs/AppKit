    /// - Draw the image itself and return nil.

    ///   - sender: The NSImage object that encountered the problem.
    ///   - rect: The rectangle that the image object was attempting to draw.
    /// - Returns: An NSImage to draw in place of the one in sender, or nil if the delegate wants to draw the image itself.
